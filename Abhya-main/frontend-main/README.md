# Abhya
## About The Project
Gone are the days when you would fear to go out alone at night. Abhya provides a unique solution which entirely transforms the whole situation. Now one can go out fearlessly wherever and whenever they want.

In recent years, there have been many cases of violence against women which could have been prevented if the authorities would have detected it earlier and had taken proper action. This web app helps the Police to streamline their way of work and work effectively towards women safety which is a major issue in our country.

Our web application will help to detect violence, and as soon as the violence is detected, the application will send an alert to the nearby police station. The police can further decide if the situation needs an emergency action as well as what other departments to communicate with.We also have an option to ignore the alert if thereâ€™s some misunderstanding and it is not actually a case of violence.

This web application will provide a faster interface of reporting to the police station and hence prevent any delay in taking action as the officer incharge would be immediately notified.It will make sure that no act of violence goes unnoticed in the area under surveillance.
